WARNING: This app is for educational purposes only, and under no circumstance should you adjust your own bindings. Always see a certified technician for any binding work to ensure your equipment is safe to use. Your bindings must be currently indemnified by their manufacturer and set up correctly by a certified technician to achieve the correct forward pressure. In addition, they must be tested by a certified technician to ensure they release within the manufacturer's specifications.


If the bindings are professionally adjusted and tested, the DIN setting determines the safest release tension setting for your bindings, provided the skier details are accurate.
The information provided in this application is calculated using the 2016/17 Marker DIN chart, which can be found on page 126 of the following document:
